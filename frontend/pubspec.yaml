    # Jost is a variable font, so we only need one file for multiple weights.
    # Flutter does not currently support custom 'wght' axes directly,
    # but we can still use different FontWeight values in Dart (e.g., FontWeight.w700).
    # The same font file will be used, and Flutter will try to approximate the desired weight.
